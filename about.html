        <div><h3><p id="about">Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. Our chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, 
        and Turkish culture. We have a menu of 12 items that we rotate seasonally. Our restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.
        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant. To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy. 
        Adrian does all the marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.
