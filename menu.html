                        <p>​Piyaz salad is one of the Turkish city's most famous dishes -- 
                        and its secret ingredient is its beans.
                        They're not just any old butter bean, but a small version known as candir, named after the inland province where they're grown.
                        Delicate and flavorful, candir are mixed, together with tahini thinned with a little water, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, garlic, flat-leaf parsley and olive oil.
                        In the very traditional version, a soft boiled egg is roughly chopped up and mixed through just before serving.</p>
                    <li><h4>Mercimek kofte</h4><img id="object2" src="mercimek.jpeg"></li>
                        <p>Mercimek kofte is a hugely popular Turkish appetizer or side dish.
                        Known to Diyarbakir locals as belluh, mercimek kofte is a vegetarian delight.
                        Made from red lentils, fine bulgur, salt, finely chopped onion, scallions, tomato and aci biber salca (hot red pepper paste) and crushed cilantro, they come in handy bite-sized servings.                          
                        Just pop one of these nuggets of flavor onto a lettuce leaf, add a squeeze of lemon juice, roll it up and munch away.</p>

                            There are numerous versions from all over Turkey, but the Antakya one includes nar eksisi (sour pomegranate molasses) and pul biber (hot red chili flakes).</p>
                    <li><h4>Inegol kofte​</h4><img id="object2" src="inegol kofte.jpeg"></li>
                        <p>Inegol Kofte -- grilled meatballs made using ground beef or lamb, breadcrumbs and onions.
                            Meatballs are so much more than just balls of meat in Turkish cuisine. Each style brings its own unique serve of history.
                            One of the best known is Inegol kofte, invented by one Mustafa Efendi. Originally from Bulgaria, he migrated to Inegol in northwest Turkey in the 19th century.
                            Unlike other Turkish kofte his mix uses only ground beef or lamb and breadcrumbs, seasoned with onions.</p>
