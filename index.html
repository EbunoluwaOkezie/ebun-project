              ​Piyaz salad is one of the Turkish city's most famous dishes --
              and its secret ingredient is its beans. They're not just any old
              butter bean, but a small version known as candir, named after the
              inland province where they're grown. Delicate and flavorful,
              candir are mixed, together with tahini thinned with a little
              water, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, garlic, flat-leaf parsley and
              olive oil. In the very traditional version, a soft boiled egg is
              roughly chopped up and mixed through just before serving.
